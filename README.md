# sand-game
A simple falling sand game written in javascript using p5.

# Usage
The project itself is written including a node server (server.js). To use the node server (assuming you have the latest version of node installed), after cloning the repository run **npm install** to install the dependencies and then run **node .** to run the server. If you only want to run the project locally, all you need is the public folder containing all the web code.
